# Documentation - Bread Board PBX (BB_PBX)

This simple telephone Private Branch Exchange (PBX) uses ready made modules:

* [Subscriber Line Interface Circuit (SLIC)](/docs/Ring_SLIC_Interface.pdf)
* [PSTN Interface circuit](/docs/RT03106_Ag2120-datasheet-PSTN-interface.pdf) & [Schematic Drawing](/docs/RT03106_schem.jpeg)
* [Audio WAV/MP3 players](/docs/KOOBOOK_SD_Audio_player.pdf)
* [DTMF decoder module](/docs/MT8870.jpg)
* [Relay Board](/docs/4DPDT_Relay_board.jpeg) & [Schematic Drawing](/docs/4DPDT_Relay_board_schem.jpeg)


The modules are connected to a Micromite PIC32 microcontroller that is running an embedded BASIC called MMBasic.

* Micromite - https://geoffg.net/micromite.html
* [MMBASIC PIC32 Schematic](/docs/PIC32MX170F256B_drawing.jpeg)
* PICAXE 8 pin microcontroller ring generator

Due to the amount of I/O pins needed to control the modules the Micromite PIC32 microcontroller can support just two extentions (SLICs) and one PSTN module.
An I/O extender could be used in the future.

## Features

* Pulse rotary dialing
* Two Extensions
* One Public Switch Telephone Network port (to connect to the world)
* Progress Tones presented to the two extensions (dialtone, ringing, etc.)
* Extension can dial and ring each other by using an assigned extension number
* Simple ring generator using a PICAXE 8 pin microcontroller dedicated to each SLIC using only a single I/O pin and no software on the PIC32

## Description

With two (2) SLICs and one (1) PSTN module the system is fairly simple. The SLICs have to be monitored by the microcontroller to detect when a phone goes offhook, etc. It was decided to attempt to do the control software without the use of interrupts. MMBASIC does support interrupts but they are not used at this time. The system design philosophy is keep everything modular and have each system block do as much as possible. For example, progress tones in the system are generated by a SD Card based MP3/Wave player, this avoids burdening the microcontroller from generating tones and with recordings we can generate authentic tones like the "old time" dialtone along with actual voice messages. Using the I/O pins on the microcontroller to the SD Card play we can just set the bit pattern to play the required file and the player will continue to play that file until told to stop.
